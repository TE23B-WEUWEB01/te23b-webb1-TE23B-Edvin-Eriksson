            <p>The subject of this week’s circular Hubble Picture of the Week <br>
                is situated in the Perseus Cluster, also known as Abell 426, 320 million <br>
                light-years from Earth. It’s a barred spiral galaxy known as MCG+07-07-072, seen here among a number of photobombing stars <br>
                that are much closer to Earth than it is. MCG+07-07-072 has quite an unusual shape, for a spiral galaxy, with thin arms emerging from <br>
                the ends of its barred core brto draw bra near-circle around its disc.</p>

            <p>In this image of the Serpens Nebula from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, <br>
                astronomers found a grouping of aligned protostellar outflows within one small region <br>
                (the top left corner). Serpens is a reflection nebula, which means it’s a cloud of gas and dust that does not create its own light, <br>
                but instead shines by reflecting the light from stars close to or within the nebula.</p>

            <p>This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image is a wonderfully <br>
                 detailed snapshot of the spiral galaxy NGC 3430 that lies 100 million light-years from Earth in the constellation <br>
                 Leo Minor.</p>

            <p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured this image of Saturn on July 4, 2020. <br>
                 Two of Saturn's icy moons are clearly visible in this exposure: Mimas at right, and Enceladus at bottom. <br>
                  This image is taken as part of the Outer Planets Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) project. <br>
                  OPAL is helping scientists understand the atmospheric dynamics and evolution of our solar system's gas giant planets. <br>
                  In Saturn's case, astronomers continue tracking shifting weather patterns and storms.</p>

                    Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second-largest in the Solar System. It is the only moon
                    known to have an atmosphere denser than the Earth's and is the only known object in space—other than
                    Earth—on which there is clear evidence that stable bodies of liquid exist. Titan is one of seven
                    gravitationally rounded moons of Saturn and the second-most distant among them. Frequently described
                    as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger in diameter than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is
                    the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's Ganymede and is larger than Mercury; yet
                    Titan is only 40% as massive as Mercury, because Mercury is mainly iron and rock while much of Titan
                    is ice, which is less dense.

                Frigid and alien, yet similar to our own planet billions of years ago,
                    Saturn's largest
                    moon, Titan, has a thick atmosphere, organic-rich chemistry and a surface shaped by rivers and lakes
                    of liquid ethane and methane. Cold winds sculpt vast regions of hydrocarbon-rich dunes. There may
                    even be cryovolcanoes of cold liquid water. NASA's Cassini orbiter was designed to peer through
                    Titan's perpetual haze and unravel the mysteries of this planet-like moon.
